Port of an EmuTarkov mod. It enhances the thermals to also function as night vision goggles, significantly increasing visibility by allowing you to see the textures you're looking at instead of just the heat content. You can also see light and shadow.

There is an alternate color scheme available as well. Check settings.json.
